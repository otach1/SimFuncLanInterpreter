# Simle Function Langague Interpreter  
## Work for Compiler Principles in XDU
You can draw lines, curves, and circles by reading instructions from a text file. It involves building a lexer, scanner, parser, semantic analyzer, and executor. In addition to the required compilation and execution, it can also be interpreted.   
  
Regular expressions are used for designing the lexer of a simple language, production rules for designing its syntax, and recursive descent subroutines for writing an interpreter for the language.  

I also made modifications to the Turtle to align the coordinate axes with the assignment requirements
## Environment:
